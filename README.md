# Simple FAQ React App

This is a simple FAQ React app that allows users to browse through frequently asked questions and find answers to them. The app is built using React and designed to be easily customizable and extensible.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/faq-react-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd faq-react-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ``
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## Usage

Once the development server has started, you can access the app by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

The app displays a list of frequently asked questions. Clicking on a question will reveal its corresponding answer. You can toggle the visibility of each answer by clicking on its question.

To add or modify the list of questions and answers, you can edit the `src/data/faqs.js` file. Each FAQ item is represented as an object with `question` and `answer` properties. Simply add or update the objects to customize the content.

## Customization

The app is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the styles, layout, and functionality to suit your needs.

- **Styles**: The app uses CSS modules for styling. You can modify the styles by editing the CSS files located in the `src/components` directory.

- **Layout**: The app's layout can be modified by editing the components in the `src/components` directory. You can add, remove, or rearrange components to achieve the desired layout.

- **Functionality**: The app's functionality can be extended by modifying the components in the `src/components` directory. You can add new features or modify existing ones to meet your requirements.

## Deployment

To deploy the app for production, you can use the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized and minified files that can be deployed to a web server.

You can find more information about deploying a React app in the [React documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/).
